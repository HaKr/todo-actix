# todo-actix
Spin-off of the excellent ToDo implementation at https://github.com/nemesiscodex/actix-todo by Julio Daniel Reyes.

My first attempt of running Julio's code ended up in a lot of compilation errors. 
Since I am not fluent in Rust, I decided to start over and see how to get it back working.

This repository holds only a partial implementation of the ToDo backend, but that compiles in the 2018 edition
